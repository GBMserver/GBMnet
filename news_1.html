<p>There have been lots of bugs in the network recently, so i fixed a few. 
One of them is "exclusive_mead" not working, so thats fixed.</p>
<p>There is also some new features! I added a new mode for mentally insane people called "Sideways". You can also play the new public level called "strafefly".
<p>And finally, I added multiplayer! I'll tell you all how to use it soon.</p>
