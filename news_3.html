<p> I am making a unity version of strafes.edu! You will have to play through all the levels every time, which could be good. The best part is easily making different levels of ground. I have been learning c# and so far it isn't that bad! </p> The game will not have as many levels as the gbmnet version on scratch, but as i learn c# there will be more and more projects
